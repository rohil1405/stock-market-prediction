Stock Market Prediction based on Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis

# Contents:

##   1) Introduction:

- Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange.         
- The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yeid significant profit.

## 2) Framework:
- Stramlit
 - Tensor flow
- Domain:
     Machine learning
- Jupyter notebook

## 3) Background therory and problem statement:
- The Stock Market prediction task is interesting as well as divides researchers and academics into two groups those who believe that we can device mechanisms to predict the market and those who believe that the market is efficient and whenever new information comes up the market absorbs it by correcting itself, thus there is no space for prediction

## 4) Features of Project
- Predicting the stock market was a time consuming and 
laborious procedure a few years ago However with the 
use of this project the procedure has become much 
simpler.
- With the use of this project anyone can find any stock 
details in just one click.
- This project will save your time and work

## 9) Conclusion

- The stock market plays a remarkable role in our daily lives. It is a significant 
factor in a country's GDP growth. In this tutorial, you learned the basics of the 
stock market and how to perform stock price prediction using machine 
learning.

- If you are interested in learning further about Machine Learning, including the 
various ML applications across industries, do explore Simplilearn’s Post 
Graduate Program in AI and Machine Learning in partnership with Purdue 
University, and in collaboration with IBM. This comprehensive 12-month 
program covers everything from Statistics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, 
Reinforcement Learning, to Natural Language Programming and more. You 
get to learn from global experts and at the end of the program walk away with 
great endorsements from industry and academic leaders and a skillet that is 
today the most in-demand in organizations across the world.
